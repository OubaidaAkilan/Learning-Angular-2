# RoutingApp


## Navigation

We can navigate using two methods:

1- Declarative Navigation

- Is when you use Angular directives like routerLink in your templates to define navigation links.

- This method allows you to define navigation links directly in your HTML templates without writing TypeScript code.

[Example in my code](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Learning-Angular-2/blob/main/routing-app/src/app/app.component.html).

- If you want to add custom style to links you can use the routerLinkActive="your.class" directive.

- If you want to custom style for exact path like /about you can use the [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{ exact: true }" directive, this option will match the same path to apply your custom style.

```typescript
<ul>
  <li routerLinkActive="your.class"><a routerLink="/home">Home</a></li>
  <li  routerLinkActive="another.class"><a routerLink="/about">About</a></li>
</ul>

```

- If you have a param and you want to pass it using router link you can use `[routerLink]` attribute binding to create navigation links dynamically. (localhost:4200/servers/123)

>note: You can pass many param like this [routerLink]="['/users', user.id, user.name]" , here we pass the id and name as param.

- You can pass a queryParam too, using `[queryParams]` attribute. (localhost:4200/servers/123?allowEdit=1)

- And you can navigate into specific section in your page using the `fragment` attribute. (localhost:4200/servers/123?allowEdit=1#cashSection)

```typescript
  <a
        [routerLink]="['/servers', server.id]"
        [queryParams]="{ allowEdit: server.id === 3 ? '1' : '0' }"
        fragment="cashSection"
        class="list-group-item"
        *ngFor="let server of servers"
      >
        {{ server.name }}
      </a>
```

2- Programmatic Navigation

- Is when you use TypeScript code to navigate from one component to another, the main class  responsible for programmatic navigation is the Router class from @angular/router.  

- we typically inject the Router service into your component and use its method like `navigate()` to navigate to different routes.

[Example in my code](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Learning-Angular-2/blob/main/routing-app/src/app/servers/servers.component.ts).

- The navigate() method receives an array of route segments or a string specifying the destination route.

String specifying the destination route.

```typescript
this.router.navigate('products/123/details');
```

Array of route segments

```typescript
  loadServer(id: number): void {
    // /servers/:id/edit 
    this.route.navigate(['/servers', id, 'edit'], {
      queryParams: { allowEdit: '1' },
      fragment: 'loading',
    });
  }
```

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <button (click)="navigateToHome()">Go to Home</button>
  `,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  navigateToHome() {
    this.router.navigate(['/home']); // Navigate to the 'home' route
  }
}

```

Here you can add more configration for the route like  

`relativeTo` :that meaning this new route `edit` is related with the current route for example, if the current route is `localhost:4200/server`, and you want to navigate into `localhost:4200/server/edit` you can use the `relativeTo` option to keep the current route.

```typescript

 onEdit() {
    this.router.navigate(['edit'], {
      relativeTo: this.route,
      queryParamsHandling:'preserve'
      // queryParams: { allowEdit: this.route.snapshot.queryParams['allowEdit'] },
    });
  }

```

`queryParamsHandling` : it is allowing us to control how query parameters are handled during navigation.

- `preserve` If you use 'preserve', it will preserve the existing query parameters and add the new ones without overwriting anything assume you have the following URL `/products?category=electronics&sort=price
`:

```typescript

this.router.navigate(['edit'], {
  relativeTo: this.route,
  queryParamsHandling: 'preserve',
  queryParams: { sort: 'date', filter: 'new' }
});


```

Resulting URL: `/products/edit?category=electronics&sort=price&sort=date&filter=new`,
>Notice that it preserved the original 'sort=price' parameter and added the new 'sort=date' and 'filter=new' parameters.

- `merge`: If you use 'merge', it will add or update the specified query parameters without removing any existing ones.

```typescript

this.router.navigate(['edit'], {
  relativeTo: this.route,
  queryParamsHandling: 'merge',
  queryParams: { sort: 'date', filter: 'new' }
});



```

Resulting URL: `/products/edit?category=electronics&sort=date&filter=new`,
>Notice that it merged the new parameters 'sort' and 'filter' with the existing ones.

### How to pass static or dynamic data using the Route?

Passing static data to a route:

- We can do that using the Angular route data property of the route. The route data property can contain an array of arbitrary string key-value pairs. You can use the static data to store items such as page title, I used this article [Angular Pass Data to Route: Dynamic/Static](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-pass-data-to-route/#:~:text=Angular%20allows%20us%20to%20pass,use%20the%20history%20state%20object.)  

```typescript

{ path: 'static', component: StaticComponent, data :{ id:'1', name:"Omar"}},

```

- The data value will be located in the data property of the ActivatedRoute service

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
      this.activatedroute.data.subscribe(data => {
          this.product=data;
      })
}
```

Passing Dynamic data to a Route:

- We can do that using the state object, the state can be provided in two ways.

>Note that you will lose the dynamic data if the page is refreshed.

1- Using routerLink directive

```typescript
<a [routerLink]="['dynamic']" [state]="{ id:1 , name:'Angular'}">Dynamic Data</a>
```

2- Using navigateByUrl

```typescript
this.router.navigateByUrl('/dynamic', { state: { id:1 , name:'Angular' } });
```

>We can not store primitive types like strings or numbers etc. For example, the following code results in an error because we are passing a string.

```typescript
this.router.navigateByUrl('/dynamic', { state:  'Angular' });
```

>You can only assign an object to the state object. The following code is ok.

```typescript
this.router.navigateByUrl('/dynamic', { state: {name: 'Angular' } });
```

- The state can be accessed by using the getCurrentNavigation method of the router (works only in the constructor)

```typescript
this.router.getCurrentNavigation().extras.state
```

Or use the history.state in the ngOnInit.

```typescript
console.log(history.state)
```

or use the getState method of the Location Service. This method is available in Angular 8+

```typescript
import { Location } from '@angular/common';
 
export class SomeComponent
{
  products:Product[];
 
  constructor(private location:Location){
  }
 
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.location.getState());
  }
}
```

### Route guard

In Angular, when you navigate from one view (component) to another, you often use the Angular Router. Route guards are mechanisms that allow you to control whether a route can be activated or deactivated.

[Everything you need to know about route Guard in Angular](https://itnext.io/everything-you-need-to-know-about-route-guard-in-angular-697a062d3198)

- `CanActivate`:Is a route guard that allows or denies access to a route based on the logic specified in the guard.

[In my code](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Learning-Angular-2/blob/main/routing-app/src/app/auth-guard.service.ts)

- `CanMatch`:Is a new feature that was introduced in Angular v14.2. It will activate the route and load the lazy-loaded component if all guards return true, otherwise it will navigate to the next route with the same name.

- `CanActivateChild`

- `CanDeactivate`:Is used to control the navigation away from a route. It allows you to prevent the user from leaving a route or a component until some condition is met, or to prompt the user for confirmation before navigating away.

>Note: Itâ€™s commonly used when working with forms to prevent the user from navigating away if the form has been modified but not yet submitted. We can display a modal dialog with a warning message to notify the user of any unsaved changes.
